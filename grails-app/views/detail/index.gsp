				<p>Look at my couch. My couch is amazing.</p>
				<p>I have a blue couch that is in good condition. It's being kicked out of here for a couch that matches the rest of our furniture better. It does come from a house with cats, but there is no scratch damage. Please let me know when you can come get it!</p>
